title: Introduction to my personal website
---

Welcome to my personal website! I've decided to create this site to be a permanent home for both professional and recreational projects that I either have completed or are currently working on, as well as a hosting platform for biographical data (like my CV, PubMed citations, etc.).

I'm not really sure if I'll create many blog posts yet. I guess that depends on if I have anything that is worth rambling about on the internet. In any case, I'll keep the files and information on here as up-to-date as I can.
