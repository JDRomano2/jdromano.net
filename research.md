I keep my CV updated regularly. You can find it here: [CV]({{site.url}}/pdfs/cv_jdromano.pdf)

In general, I'm interested in the following subjects:

* The discovery of therapeutic compounds found in nature (particularly proteins isolated from animal venoms) by integrating informatics and biodiversity knowledge.
* The development of algorithms and real-time computing solutions to facilitate the integration of precision medicine into daily clinical practice.
* Learning new knowledge about human genetics and genomics by mining existing datasets, particularly by incorporating biodiversity and evolution.
* Elucidating molecular mechanisms of pharmacology and disease through probabilistic and mathematical modeling.

#### Me on PubMed

Unfortunately, "Romano JD" isn't the most unique identifier. Therefore, the following query gets a lot of false positives:

[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Romano+JD](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Romano+JD)

If an article is about particle physics or traditional (wet-lab) biochemistry, then it probably isn't me. I'm planning to build a query that will return all of my MEDLINE-indexed citations within PubMed, and I'll put a link on here once I get that working.
