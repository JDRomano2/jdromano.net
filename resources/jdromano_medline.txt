AB  - Animal venoms have been used for therapeutic purposes since the dawn of recorded 
      history. Only a small fraction, however, have been tested for pharmaceutical
      utility. Modern computational methods enable the systematic exploration of novel 
      therapeutic uses for venom compounds. Unfortunately, there is currently no
      comprehensive resource describing the clinical effects of venoms to support this 
      computational analysis. We present VenomKB, a new publicly accessible knowledge
      base and website that aims to act as a repository for emerging and putative venom
      therapies. Presently, it consists of three database tables: (1) Manually curated 
      records of putative venom therapies supported by scientific literature, (2)
      automatically parsed MEDLINE articles describing compounds that may be venom
      derived, and their effects on the human body, and (3) automatically retrieved
      records from the new Semantic Medline resource that describe the effects of venom
      compounds on mammalian anatomy. Data from VenomKB may be selectively retrieved in
      a variety of popular data formats, are open-source, and will be continually
      updated as venom therapies become better understood.

TI  - Systems biology approaches for identifying adverse drug reactions and elucidating
      their underlying biological mechanisms.
PG  - 104-22

AB  - Small molecules are indispensable to modern medical therapy. However, their use
      may lead to unintended, negative medical outcomes commonly referred to as adverse
      drug reactions (ADRs). These effects vary widely in mechanism, severity, and
      populations affected, making ADR prediction and identification important public
      health concerns. Current methods rely on clinical trials and postmarket
      surveillance programs to find novel ADRs; however, clinical trials are limited by
      small sample size, whereas postmarket surveillance methods may be biased and
      inherently leave patients at risk until sufficient clinical evidence has been
      gathered. Systems pharmacology, an emerging interdisciplinary field combining
      network and chemical biology, provides important tools to uncover and understand 
      ADRs and may mitigate the drawbacks of traditional methods. In particular,
      network analysis allows researchers to integrate heterogeneous data sources and
      quantify the interactions between biological and chemical entities. Recent work
      in this area has combined chemical, biological, and large-scale observational
      health data to predict ADRs in both individual patients and global populations.
      In this review, we explore the rapid expansion of systems pharmacology in the
      study of ADRs. We enumerate the existing methods and strategies and illustrate
      progress in the field with a model framework that incorporates crucial data
      elements, such as diet and comorbidities, known to modulate ADR risk. Using this 
      framework, we highlight avenues of research that may currently be underexplored, 
      representing opportunities for future work. WIREs Syst Biol Med 2016, 8:104-122.

      gene relationships.

AB  - The characterization of complex diseases remains a great challenge for biomedical
      researchers due to the myriad interactions of genetic and environmental factors. 
      Network medicine approaches strive to accommodate these factors holistically.
      Phylogenomic techniques that can leverage available genomic data may provide an
      evolutionary perspective that may elucidate knowledge for gene networks of
      complex diseases and provide another source of information for network medicine
      approaches. Here, an automated method is presented that leverages publicly
      available genomic data and phylogenomic techniques, resulting in a gene network. 
      The potential of approach is demonstrated based on a case study of nine genes
      associated with Alzheimer Disease, a complex neurodegenerative syndrome. The
      developed technique, which is incorporated into an update to a previously
      described Perl script called "ASAP," was implemented through a suite of Ruby
      scripts entitled "ASAP2," first compiles a list of sequence-similarity based
      orthologues using PSI-BLAST and a recursive NCBI BLAST+ search strategy, then
      constructs maximum parsimony phylogenetic trees for each set of nucleotide and
      protein sequences, and calculates phylogenetic metrics (Incongruence Length
      Difference between orthologue sets, partitioned Bremer support values, combined
      branch scores, and Robinson-Foulds distance) to provide an empirical assessment
      of evolutionary conservation within a given genetic network. In addition to the
      individual phylogenetic metrics, ASAP2 provides results in a way that can be used
      to generate a gene network that represents evolutionary similarity based on
      topological similarity (the Robinson-Foulds distance). The results of this study 
      demonstrate the potential for using phylogenomic approaches that enable the study
      of multiple genes simultaneously to provide insights about potential gene
      relationships that can be studied within a network medicine framework that may
      not have been apparent using traditional, single-gene methods. Furthermore, the
      results provide an initial integrated evolutionary history of an Alzheimer
      Disease gene network and identify potentially important co-evolutionary
      clustering that may warrant further investigation.
