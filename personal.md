Aside from the work I do, I'm an avocational jazz trumpeter and classical pianist. When I have the time, I like to get away from the city to ski.

While living in Japan, I had the opportunity to study traditional Japanese cuisine. I cook as a hobby, and try to cover food and cooking styles from as many nations and cultures as I can.
