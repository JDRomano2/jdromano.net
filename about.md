Welcome to the personal website of Joe Romano. I use this as a place to showcase my past and current projects, both professional and otherwise.

I'm a data scientist and translational bioinformatics researcher at Columbia University, where I am currently working towards my PhD. Check out the [Tatonetti Lab website](http://tatonettilab.org/ "Tatonetti Lab website") to see my work and work from my colleagues, in context.
